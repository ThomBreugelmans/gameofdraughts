        <h1>RULES OF THE GAME:</h1>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. <br>Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, <br>landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. <br>Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed during a single turn.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option; the jump must be made. <br>If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>Kings are limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward. <br>(Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>Kings may combine jumps in several directions, forward and backward, on the same turn. <br>Single pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</li>
        </ul>
